          <span> <sup>Govt. Polytechnic College, Cherthala </sup></span> the
          first Professional Engineering Institution of excellence under
          Government Sector in Alappuzha district of Kerala state. Govt.
          Polytechnic College, Cherthala is a premier Technical Education center
          in Kerala targeting the rural people. Even though the institution
          located in the heart of Cherthala town, beside the national highway,
          it is surrounded by a number of villages, which are backward. This
          institution serves as a Nodal Polytechnic for the other Polytechnic
          Colleges in the Alappuzha District. This institution started
          functioning as Junior Technical School in 1959 and was later upgraded
          as Technical High School.In 1994 it was upgraded to Polytechnic
          College, Imparting three year diploma course in Engineering/Technology
          under Department of Technical Education, Government of Kerala.Later
          Govt. of Kerala has sanctioned two more Diploma courses in Engineering
          Technology. This prestigious institution now offering 3-year diploma
          courses of a unique kind in five creamy disciplines, with a view to
          creating excellent academic proficiency from a utilitarian point of
          view, the syllabi of the courses are carefully designed giving a
          thrust to the needs of the present electronics, computer, mechanical
          and general industries. The campus atmosphere of our institution is
          very much conductive to our excellent academic performance. Here each
          one works as a family striving hard to achieve high results.Our
          team,professional support staff,students' advisors,regular parent
          teacher interactions to discuss students' progress,is what makes us
          stand apart from others and has helped in building up as a strong
          institution where we can cater to the diverse academic needs of our
          students. Choosing where to continue your education is a major
          decision and I believe that Government polytechnic college cherthala
          will be a choice you will not regret, especially if you are ambitious
          and determined to succeed. As a result of our size we are able to
          focus on the needs of each individual student and aim to nurture each
          student in order to ensure their journey at Government polytechnic
          college cherthala is a successful and improves future prospects.
